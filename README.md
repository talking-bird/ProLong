## 1. Installation

- install nodejs
- install npm
- create a project:
  - `npm install --save-dev hardhat --ignore-scripts`
  - `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts`
  - `npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers`
- `pip install web3`

## 2. Running the code

1. `npm run compile` to compile contracts
2. `npm run node` to set up local blockchain ( run it in a separate shell)
3. `npm run deploy` to deploy smart contracts onto the blockchain

The addresses and keys should not change from time to time, so the ones in notebook should be good enough.

## 3. Look at notebook

Ta-daa, you can now run the notebook, congratulations!
